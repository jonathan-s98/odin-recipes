        <p>A popular snack and breakfast food, you can't go wrong eating it while drinking a nice cup of coffee.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>half a cup of olive oil or butter</li>
            <li>a third of a cup of water</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons of minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 thirds of a cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 beaten eggs</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees ºF (or 190 degrees ºC)</li>
            <li>Combine the olive oil, water, milk and salt in a large saucepan and place over high heat. Bring it to a boil and immediately remove from the heat.</li>
